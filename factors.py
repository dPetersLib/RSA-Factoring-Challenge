Factorize as many numbers as possible
into a product of two smaller numbers.

Output format: n=p*q
    one factorization per line
    p and q donâ€™t have to be prime numbers

factor - function to break an integer and find its two smallest factors

@n: integer to be factorized.

Return: always "n=p*q"
